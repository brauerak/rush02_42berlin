* * OUT = rush-02 
* ? This line defines the name of the executable file that will be generated by the make command as "rush-02".

* * SRC = main.c helper.c helper2.c error.c convert.c open_read.c
* ? This line lists all the source code files that are required to build the executable, separated by spaces.

* * OBJ = $(SRC:.c=.o)
* ? This line creates a list of object files that will be generated from the source code files listed in SRC. The ".c" is replaced by ".o" to create the names of the corresponding object files.

* * CC = gcc
* * CCFLAGS = -Wall -Werror -Wextra
* ? These lines define the compiler to be used and the compilation flags to be passed to the compiler. Here, the compiler is set to "gcc" and the flags "-Wall", "-Werror", and "-Wextra" are used. These flags enable warnings for various issues in the code, such as unused variables, uninitialized variables, and so on.

* * .PHONY: all
* * all: $(OUT)
* ? This line declares the "all" target to be a phony target, which means that it does not correspond to a file that needs to be built. The target "all" depends on the "rush-02" target, which means that running the "all" target will cause the "rush-02" target to be built first.

* * $(OUT): $(OBJ)
* *     $(CC) $(CCFLAGS) $(OBJ) -o $(OUT)
* ? This section specifies how to build the "rush-02" target. It depends on the object files listed in the $(OBJ) variable. The command $(CC) is used to link the object files into an executable with the name specified by $(OUT).

* * %.o: %.c ourlib.h
* * 	$(CC) $(CCFLAGS) -c $< -o $@
* ? This section specifies how to build each object file listed in $(OBJ). It says that each .o file depends on the corresponding .c file and "ourlib.h". The command $(CC) is used to compile the source code into an object file with the same name as the source file, but with the .o extension.

* * .PHONY: fclean
* * fclean:
* * 	rm -f $(OBJ) $(OUT)
* ? This line declares the "fclean" target to be a phony target. The target "fclean" removes the object files listed in $(OBJ) and the executable file specified by $(OUT) using the "rm" command. The "-f" option to "rm" ensures that any errors encountered while deleting files will be ignored.
